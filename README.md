<br>

## üå± Getting Started:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```commandline
https://github.com/ShaharBand/Sentinel.git
```

<br>

**2. Install Backend Dependencies:**

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the backend dependencies using the following command:

```commandline
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br>

**3. Install Frontend Dependencies:**

Before installing the Node Package Manager (NPM), you need to install Node.js.
You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official Node.js website.
<br>

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the frontend dependencies using the following command:

```commandline
cd frontend
npm install
```

This command installs the necessary Node.js packages specified in your project's `package.json` file.
<br><br>

**4. Modify the configuration settings:**

**Environment Variables**: 
To configure the application, utilize environment files (`.env`) to specify settings such as database connection details, application port, and other environment-specific configurations.

The application supports different environment settings for both development and production environments. You can find the configuration settings in `app.py`, `db.py`, and `metadata.py`, located within the backend config directory.

Each configuration has its respective environment file named as follows: `.env.app`, `.env.db`, `.env.metadata`.
The system will check for corresponding production files such as `.env.app.prod` to determine if the environment is a production environment. This allows for overriding of normal settings and the setup of workers as necessary.
<br><br>

**5. Run Backend**

In the `backend` directory, run the FastAPI backend using the following command:

```commandline
python src/app/run.py
```

- There is also **Dockerfile** in the `backend` directory if you want to try running it through Docker.

<br>

**6. Run Frontend:**

In the `frontend` directory, run the Vite.js frontend using the following command:

```commandline
npm run dev
```
