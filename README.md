<br>

## üå± Getting Started:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```commandline
https://github.com/ShaharBand/Sentinel.git
```

<br>

### 2. Backend Configuration:

To configure the application backend, utilize environment files (`.env`) to specify settings such as database connection details, application port, and other environment-specific configurations.
<br><br>


**Environment Settings:**

You can find the configuration settings in `app.py`, `db.py`, and `metadata.py`, all residing within the directory `backend/src/core/config/`.

Each configuration is designated with a distinct environment variable prefix: `APP_`, `DB_`, `METADATA_`.
<br><br>
The code checks for the `APP_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to determine if the environment is a production environment. This allows for overriding of reload settings and the setup of workers as necessary.
<br><br>

**Docker Integration**

If you plan on using Docker, the `.dockerignore` file is configured to ignore the environment files. 

This setup allows you to load the environment variables specifically for Docker Compose usage, providing flexibility for both development and production environments. 

You can also set up separate Docker Compose files for development and production (`docker-compose.dev.yml` and `docker-compose.prod.yml`) to ensure consistency across environments.
<br><br>

### 3. Running the Backend

You have two options to run the FastAPI backend:
<br><br>

**Option 1: Python Run**

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the backend dependencies using the following command:
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the FastAPI backend:
```commandline
python src/main.py
```

<br>

**Option 2: Docker Compose** 

If you prefer using Docker, you can run the application with Docker Compose. Ensure you have Docker installed on your system.

```commandline
docker-compose up --build
```

<br>

### 4. Install Frontend Dependencies: 

Before installing the Node Package Manager (NPM), you need to install Node.js.
You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official Node.js website.
<br>

Navigate to the frontend directory and install the frontend dependencies using the following command:

```commandline
cd frontend
npm install
```

This command installs the necessary Node.js packages specified in your project's `package.json` file.
<br><br>

### 5. Run Frontend: 

In the `frontend` directory, run the Vite.js frontend using the following command:

```commandline
npm run dev
```
